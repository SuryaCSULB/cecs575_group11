The application mainly focuses on the design part covering essential design principles along with Object oriented features. The brief about the project is, Customer selects Products from any Department and places Order. The Order details would be shared with Delivery Class, and DeliveryDetails will be sent to the Customer. Here, Customer is the main class which have, Order, Payment, Profile and Delivery classes as members of class. We have used four grasp patterns in this project but, we have kept room for new changes to enhance the functionalities. We explained about each grasp pattern using a design in the comments. We are developing the app on Android Studio using java as Business logic code, XML as front end. We are using SQL Lite DB as backend. For OTP authentication we are using firebase.
